# SI1146-software

This a set of sorce, library written to for the Silcon Labs SI114X range.

Requires: Python smbus to run on the raspberry pi (sudo apt-get install python-smbus ) 

So Far:
  Python code works for SI1146 v0.1
  
To Do:
  Wrap Python code as class module 
  remove debug BLOAT
  comment properly 
  add example 
  extend code to work with SI1145 and SI1147
  Add C library version for raspberry pi 
  Add Arduino library (Bassed on Adafruits SI1145 with the extar parts to use it will all SI114x range 
  
None of this could be done without the guidance from code provided by both Silicon Labs and  Adafruit thanks guys
